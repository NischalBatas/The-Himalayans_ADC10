The Liskov Substitution Principle:
	The Liskov Substitution principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in her conference keynote “Data abstraction” in 1987. The Liskov Substitution Principle states that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior.
For example:
//not following Liskov Substitution Principle
public class Vehicle(
	public void consumeDeisel(){
	}
	public void consumePetrol(){
	}
	public void servicing(){
	}
)
// following Liskov Substitution Principle
public class Vehicle{
	public void servicing(){
	}
}
//for bus
public class Bus extends Vehicle{
	public void consumeDiesel(){	}
}
//for bike
public class Bike extends Vehicle{
	public void consumePetrol(){
	}
}
